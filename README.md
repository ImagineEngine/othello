# **OTHELLO PYTHON PROJECT**



### Gameplay:



###### Objective:

To have the most discs of your color at the end of the game



###### Rules:

* You can only place a disc in such a way that you outflank your opponent (ie. your opponents discs have to be sandwiched between your disc you placed).
* Once you place the disc, all the opponents discs that are sandwiched get flipped to match your color.
* If there are no possible moves in which you can outflank your opponent, then you forfeit your turn.
* You are allowed to flip discs only until you reach one of your own.
* Black always goes first.





### How to play:

* Run main.py
* The board will start with a default configuration, and the players (ie. Black and White) have to take turns clicking on the possible moves.
* All the valid moves will be shown with a highlighted ring on the board.
* There is a counter present at the bottom to show the number of discs of your respective colors.
* The winner is declared at the end of the game.
* After you close the game, you can just re-run the program to pick up where you left off.
